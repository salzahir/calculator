# Calculator Project

This is a simple, interactive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as additional functionalities like clear (`A/C`), change sign (`+/-`), and percentage (`%`).

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
- **Clear Button (`A/C`):** Clears the input and resets the calculation.
- **Sign Toggle (`+/-`):** Allows the user to toggle the sign of the current number.
- **Percentage (`%`):** Allows percentage calculations.
- **Equals Button (`=`):** Computes the result of the entered expression.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure and content of the calculator interface.
- **styles.css**: Stylesheet for the layout and appearance of the calculator.
- **index.js**: JavaScript for handling the logic behind the calculator operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view and use the calculator.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content and layout of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Provides styles for the calculator interface and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for the calculator's operations, button interactions, and input management.

## Future Improvements

- Add keyboard support for users to interact with the calculator using their keyboard.
- Implement more advanced mathematical operations like square root, power, etc.
- Improve responsiveness for mobile devices.
